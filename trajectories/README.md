# Sequence and cluster analysis to create heat trajectories

ðŸ’¬ Language: R

ðŸ“Œ Section summary: 60 yearsâ€™ worth of climate projection data at 5km2 resolution is tricky to interpret. This section details how we use sequence and cluster analysis, a technique for the mining and visualising sequences of categorical data, to identify common trajectories in the data. 

*Sequence analysis:* Our sequence analysis measures the differences in maximum summer temperature over time across grid squares. We choose an Optimal Matching sequence algorithm most commonly applied to small area units - 5km2 grid squares in this case. Optimal Matching conceptualises similarity as the minimum number of operations that are required to turn one sequence into another. If fewer operations are required to turn one sequence into another, the sequences are considered more similar, and vice versa. The result is a dissimilarity matrix between individual sequences. To generate the dissimilarity matrix, we set the substitution cost as based on the transition rates observed between all pairs of states in the data, with a cost of one for deleting or inserting an element into the sequence. 

*Cluster analysis:* Sequences are clustered to identify common trajectories. We opt for a ward clustering approach and test cluster solutions from 1-20. Using common diagnostics, a four-cluster solution is identified as most appropriate, minimising within- and between-cluster variation. 

*Naming clusters:* We name the trajectories: â€˜Cooler extremesâ€™, â€˜Moderately cooler extremesâ€™, â€˜Moderately warmer extremesâ€™, and â€˜Warmer extremesâ€™. Names are based on the temperatures and change over time and are relative to one another.
