# Uneven ambient futures: Intersecting heat and housing trajectories in England and Wales
We apply sequence and cluster analysis to Met Office climate projections to identify and characterise potential trajectories of extreme summer temperatures. Heat trajectories are juxtaposed with housing data for ~15 million individual properties detailing type, quality, and characteristics, derived from Energy Performance Certificates, as well as other socio-demographic data. Our approach is deliberately somewhat â€˜speculativeâ€™ - a rehearsal spaces of sorts for different ways of responding to the prospect of uncertain futures. This enables us to consider different vulnerabilities that are likely to be reinforced, produced, or remediated by extreme summer temperatures. 

ðŸ’¬ **Language:** R

ðŸ§± **Repository structure:** 
The analysis breaks down into three sections.

*[Heat:](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/heat-housing-trajectories/tree/main/heat)* Accessing summer maximum temperature data from Met Office UK Climate Projections 2018.

*[Trajectories:](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/heat-housing-trajectories/tree/main/trajectories)* Using sequence and cluster analysis to identify common temperature trajectories.

*[Housing:](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/heat-housing-trajectories/tree/main/housing)* Contextualising trajectories with data about housing from Energy Performance Certificates and other demographic datasets for neighbourhoods.
